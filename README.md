    -   `_datalayer.vm` set up as a standalone configuration that can be imported in other scripts
    -   `hashmap.vm` review of hashmap methods and syntax styles. More methods are covered here than time allowed for in the conference talk. Take a look at the deep copy macros and use of `hashCode()` for comparing shallow and deep copies.
