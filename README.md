# Cascade User Conference 2025: Create Your Own Datalayer

Thanks for visiting this repo. Mentioned in the February 19, 2025 Cascade User Conference (CUC2025) talk, this repo contains some of the example files and downloads mentioned in the slide deck. Here's a breakdown of the contents:

-   Example files: these are the snippets of Velocity shown in the presentation deck
    -   `_datalayer.vm` set up as a standalone configuration that can be imported in other scripts
    -   `hashmap.vm` review of hashmap methods and syntax styles. More methods are covered here than time allowed for in the conference talk. Take a look at the deep copy macros and use of `hashCode()` for comparing shallow and deep copies.
    -   `multiple-params-vs-map.vm` shows two approaches to passing parameters to macros
    -   `serializer-json-output.json` sample output for reference
