# Cascade User Conference 2025: Create Your Own Datalayer

Thanks for visiting this repo. Here's a breakdown of the contents:

-   Example files: these are the snippets of Velocity shown in the presentation deck
    -   `_datalayer.vm` set up as a standalone configuration that can be imported in other scripts
    -   `hashmap.vm` review of hashmap methods and syntax styles. More methods are covered here than time allowed for in the conference talk. Take a look at the deep copy macros and use of `hashCode()` for comparing shallow and deep copies.
    -   `multiple-params-vs-map.vm` shows two approaches to passing parameters to macros
    -   `serializer-json-output.json` sample output for reference
